        <p class=MsoNormal>Meal Book is a webapp that allows users to simplify their cooking and shopping habits with ease. While you can sign in as a guest to view meals and try out Meal Book’s functionality, we suggest creating an account so you can save recipes and ingredients for later. Simply browse through our repository of delicious meals and add one to your list – we’ll take care of the rest.</p>

        <h2>Meal Browser</h2>

        <img src="imgs/Meal_Viewer.png">

        <p class=MsoNormal>Here, you can view all the meals hosted on Meal Book. There is a handy search function and a suite of tools to help you manage your account’s recipes. Additionally, our database is open to you – feel free to add and edit your own meals to share with the world! If you like one, save it, and if you change your mind, unsave it. After all, each user has a personal list of saved meals they can browse as they please.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients Viewer</h2>

        <img src="imgs/Ingredients_Viewer.png">

        <p class=MsoNormal>Each user has a personal list of ingredients they can use when shopping – this displays the type and quantity of ingredients you’ll need to cook every meal on your list. It is automatically updated with your personal meal list, so don’t worry about managing it – keeping shopping lists in your phone’s notes app is a thing of the past.</p>

        <h2>Recipe Viewer</h2>

        <img src="imgs/Recipe_Viewer.png">

        <p class=MsoNormal>Now that you’ve figured out which meals you’d like to cook, use our recipe viewer to view it. You’ll see how long it takes to cook, its nutritional data, its ingredients, and the most important element – the instructions. Here, we provide easy instructions on how to recreate the dishes in our vast repository.</p>
